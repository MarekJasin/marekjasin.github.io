I am a Doctoral Research Fellow in Economics at Statistics Norway/University of Oslo. My current research interests are in theoretical and applied macroeconomics, consumption theory and household finance.  I have a particular interest in understanding how household heterogeneity affects the transmission of aggregate shocks.
